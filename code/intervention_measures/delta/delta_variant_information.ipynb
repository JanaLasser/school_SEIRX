    "* Incubation period (time until symptoms): 4.4 +-1.9 days, see [Zhang et al. 2021](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/cn/article/doi/10.46234/ccdcw2021.148) (wild type 6.4 +- 0.8 days)\n",
    "* Latent period (exposure duration): no published information available. Take the difference between incubation period and latent period in the wild type (1.4 days), subtract it from the delta incubation period and end up at 3 +- 1.9 days, with no modification to the standard deviation (wild type 5.0 +- 1.9 days).\n",
    "* Infection duration: coud not find published data for differences of Delta to the wild type. Keep an infection duration of 10.91 +- 3.95 days.\n",
    "* Delta is ~2 x more infectious than the wild type (reproductive number of ~5, WT was ~2.5). See [Liu and Rockl√∂v 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taab124/6346388?login=true), [Campbell et al. 2021](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.24.2100509). Therefore the calibrated base transmission risk is 0.073670 * 2 = 0.14734. This results is comparable with secondary attack rates of 13.5% ([Dagpunar et al. 2021](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.03.21258293v1.full.pdf), primary source Public Health England, \"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England\", technical briefing 12, 2021)."
