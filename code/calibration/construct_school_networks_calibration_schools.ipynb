    "In this script, contact networks of \"average\" Austrian schools, depending on school type are created for the purpose of calibrating the simulation. These characteristics (mean number of classes, mean students per class) were determined from [statistics about Austrian schools](https://www.bmbwf.gv.at/Themen/schule/schulsystem/gd.html) (year 2017/18, page 10) and confirmed in interviews with a range of Austrian teachers and school directors conducted in December 2020. The school types modeled here are\n",

    "* Secondary schools with daycare (Gymnasium mit Ganztagesbetreuung), ```secondary_dc``` \n",
    "\n",
    "For every school type, 500 different implementations of the same network are created. Two networks of the same school type with the same characteristics (class size, number of students) can still be different, because the households are created randomly from underlying distributions. This is important since a strong component of disease spread between classes in the same school is the connection between siblings that live in the same household and go to the same school but different classes. These connections will be different for every implementation of the same school network. Here we create 500 different networks, since for the calibration we simulate 500 runs for every parameter combination, and therefore every run is simulated on a slightly different network, sampling different constellations of households.\n",

    "**NOTE**: A more detailed description about the design decisions entering the modeling of each school type can be found in the document ```school_type_documentation```. In the following, \"students\" always refers to the number of students per class.  "
